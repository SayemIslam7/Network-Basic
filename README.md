## Network Basics for IT Support Professionals

### 1. Network Types and Topologies
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Connects devices within a limited area, such as an office.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Connects multiple LANs over large geographic areas.
- **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**: Uses wireless technology to connect devices within a LAN.
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Connects personal devices within a short range, typically using Bluetooth.

### Network Topologies:
- **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
- **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, providing multiple paths for data.

### 2. Essential Networking Devices
- **Router**: Connects multiple networks and routes data between them.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data.
- **Access Point (AP)**: Provides wireless connectivity within a network.
- **Modem**: Converts digital signals to analog for transmission over telephone lines and vice versa.
- **Firewall**: Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

### 3. Common Networking Protocols
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Fundamental suite of protocols for internet communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**: Protocols for web communication.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files between computers.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

### 4. Basic IP Addressing and Subnetting
- **IP Address**: Unique identifier for a device on a network (e.g., IPv4: 192.168.1.1, IPv6: 2001:0db8::1).
- **Subnet Mask**: Divides an IP address into network and host portions (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
- **Default Gateway**: The device that routes traffic from a local network to external networks.
- **DNS Server**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.

### 5. Network Security Basics
- **Firewall**: Blocks unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.
- **Encryption**: Protects data by converting it into a secure format during transmission.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Creates a secure connection over the internet.
- **Antivirus Software**: Protects devices from malware and viruses.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

### 6. Common Network Troubleshooting Techniques
- **Ping**: Tests connectivity between devices.
- **Traceroute**: Tracks the path packets take to reach their destination.
- **IPConfig/IFConfig**: Displays network configuration details.
- **NSLookup**: Queries DNS to obtain domain name or IP address information.
- **Wireshark**: Captures and analyzes network traffic.
- **Check Physical Connections**: Ensure cables and devices are properly connected.
- **Restart Devices**: Restart routers, switches, and computers to resolve connectivity issues.
- **Update Drivers/Firmware**: Ensure network devices have the latest updates installed.
